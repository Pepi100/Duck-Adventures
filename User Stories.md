Our team plans to create an open-world mobile game for Android devices. The game puts the player in the role of a duck who must retrieve their stolen eggs by completing a series of minigames. The order in which the player completes the minigames is up to them, and they will receive items for each successfully completed game. The final challenge involves facing off against a vulture in a final showdown. Our game will be made in Unity (C#), and we plan to use Github for source control and task management.
